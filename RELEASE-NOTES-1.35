== MediaWiki 1.35.0-PRERELEASE ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.35 is an alpha-quality development branch, and is not recommended
for use in production.

== Upgrading notes for 1.35 ==
1.35 has several database changes since 1.34, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions, including
important information when upgrading from versions prior to 1.11.

for pages that explicitly state that their contents are in the public domain):

       https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Documentation

== Mailing list ==
A mailing list is available for MediaWiki user support and discussion:

       https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

       https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.
