== MediaWiki 1.34.0-PRERELEASE ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.34 is an alpha-quality development branch, and is not recommended
for use in production.

== Upgrading notes for 1.34 ==
1.34 has several database changes since 1.33, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions, including
important information when upgrading from versions prior to 1.11.

Some specific notes for MediaWiki 1.34 upgrades are below:

=== Action API changes in 1.34 ===
* The 'recenteditcount' response property from action=query list=allusers,
  deprecated in 1.25, has been removed.

=== Action API internal changes in 1.34 ===
* …

=== Languages updated in 1.34 ===
MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated regularly.
Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as changes to languages
because of Phabricator reports.

* (T152908) Added language support for N'Ko (nqo).

=== Breaking changes in 1.34 ===
* Preferences class, deprecated in 1.31, has been removed.
* The following parts of code, deprecated in 1.32, were removed in favor of
  built-in PHP functions:
  * CryptRand class
  * CryptRand service
  * Functions of the MWCryptRand class: singleton(), wasStrong() and generate().
* Language::setCode, deprecated in 1.32, was removed. Use Language::factory to
  create a new Language object with a different language code.
* MWNamespace::clearCaches() has been removed.  So has the $rebuild parameter
  to MWNamespace::getCanonicalNamespaces(), which was deprecated since 1.31.
  Instead, reset services, such as by calling $this->overrideMwServices() (if
  your test extends MediaWikiTestCase). Services will generally not pick up
  configuration changes from after they were created, so you must reset
  services after any configuration change. Even if your code works now, it is
  likely to break in future versions as more code is moved to services.
* The ill-defined "DatabaseOraclePostInit" hook has been removed.
* PreferencesFormLegacy and PreferencesForm classes, deprecated in 1.32, have
  been removed.
* ObjectFactory class, deprecated in 1.31, has been removed.
* HWLDFWordAccumudlator class, deprecated in 1.28, has been removed.
* XMPInfo, XMPReader and XMPValidate, deprecated in 1.32, have been removed.
* The RedirectSpecialPage::execute method could sometimes return a Title object.
  This behavior was removed, and the method now matches the parent signature
  (SpecialPage::execute) which is to return HTML string or void.
  To obtain the destination title, use RedirectSpecialPage::getRedirect.
* The 'recenteditcount' response property from action API action=query
  list=allusers, deprecated in 1.25, has been removed.
* SearchEngine::userNamespaces(), SearchEngine::namespacesAsText(),
  SearchEngine::create(), SearchEngine::getSearchTypes() and
  SearchEngine::getNearMatch(), methods deprecated in 1.27, have been removed.
* FileRepo::streamFile(), deprecated in 1.26, has been removed.
* User::randomPassword() method, deprecated in 1.27, have been removed.
* MWNamespace::canTalk(), deprecated in 1.30, have been removed.
* Parser class property $mUniqPrefix, deprecated in 1.26, has been removed.
* wfArrayFilter() and wfArrayFilterByKey(), deprecated in 1.32, have been
  removed.
* wfMakeUrlIndexes() function, deprecated in 1.33, have been removed.
* User::getGroupPage() and ::makeGroupLinkHTML(), deprecated in 1.29, have been
  removed. Use UserGroupMembership::getGroupPage and ::getLink instead.
* User::makeGroupLinkWiki(), deprecated in 1.29, has been removed. Use
  UserGroupMembership::getLink() instead.
* …

=== Deprecations in 1.34 ===
* The MWNamespace class is deprecated. Use MediaWikiServices::getNamespaceInfo.
* ExtensionRegistry->load() is deprecated, as it breaks dependency checking.
  Instead, use ->queue().
* User::isBlocked() is deprecated since it does not tell you if the user is
  blocked from editing a particular page. Use User::getBlock() or
  PermissionManager::isBlockedFrom() or PermissionManager::userCan() instead.
* User::isLocallyBlockedProxy and User::inDnsBlacklist are deprecated and moved
  to the BlockManager as private helper methods.
* User::isDnsBlacklisted is deprecated. Use BlockManager::isDnsBlacklisted
  instead.
* The Config argument to ChangesListSpecialPage::checkStructuredFilterUiEnabled
  is deprecated. Pass only the User argument.
* WatchedItem::getUser is deprecated. Use getUserIdentity.
* Passing a Title as the first parameter to the getTimestampById method of
  RevisionStore is deprecated. Omit it, passing only the remaining parameters.
